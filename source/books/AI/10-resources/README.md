        - Create and evolve AI Primitives—the key patterns native to AI products that set new standards for usability and delight
        - Partner closely with engineers to ensure designs are reflected in code and are actively used by teams across the organization
        - Contribute to design guidelines, documentation, and frameworks that help teams ship experiments faster and avoid reinventing the wheel
        - Collaborate with product teams to understand their needs, support rapid prototyping, and help unlock frontier interfaces for novel UX challenges
        - Balance immediate team needs with long-term system vision, knowing that "speed of innovation matters more than consistency"
        - Rapidly prototype ideas using code and other methods to communicate concepts and build excitement
        
        Example projects:
        - Design and implement core UI components like modals, navigation patterns, or interactive elements that raise the baseline quality of all our products
        - Create design primitives for AI-specific interactions like tool use, steerability, agent behaviors, and other patterns native to AI products
        - Partner with teams on signature interactions in the experience that showcase distinctive, differentiated experiences in the Claude interface
        - Develop guidelines for content, color usage, or accessibility when coded solutions aren't feasible
        Support teams in rapidly prototyping new ideas while maintaining baseline quality standards
        - Create systems that live in code, working closely with engineers to ensure components are implemented and used
        - Build bridges and create a permeable membrane for contributions, enabling teams rather than gatekeeping their work
        
        You may be a good fit if you have:
        - 8+ years of product design experience, with some period building or maintaining a design system
        - Strong portfolio showcasing user-centric design thinking, polished UI craftsmanship, and innovative interaction paradigms
        - Proven track record of creating and maintaining design systems that enable teams to move faster
        - Experience partnering with engineering teams and "speaking engineering" to ensure designs are implemented in code
        - Excellent collaboration and communication skills to work effectively with cross-functional teams and influence without authority
        - Passion for enabling teams, unblocking projects, and making high-quality design accessible to all
        - Experience with prototyping, especially using front-end code (e.g. HTML/CSS/JS) preferred
        - Understanding of accessibility standards and best practices
        
        Additionally we look for candidates who demonstrate an ability to:
        - Ship opinionated products and make things customers want
        - Model a builder mindset to explore and communicate through prototyping and design
        - Be proactive and make things happen in a startup environment
        - Have a technical understanding of LLMs and can build on top of them
        - Design new, functional and easy to use interaction design conventions that are on the frontier
        - Balance system consistency with speed of innovation
        - Create inclusive and networked teams that welcome contributions from across the organization
        
        The expected salary range for this position is:
        Annual Salary:
        $305,000 - $385,000 USD

        Logistics
        - Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
        - Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
        - Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

        We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
